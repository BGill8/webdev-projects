            The most complex thing that I have done with web development was create simple pages with HTML,
            and mess around with font color, styles, and background colors with a little bit of CSS.

        <p>
            I hope to be fully capable of creating my own websites from this course and to impress my friends and family,
            and be fully confident to execute on any engaging idea I have in the future for a website.

            <li>I have signed up for Ed, which is the replacement for Campuswire forum.</li>

        <p>
            The most unique thing about me (that I can think of right now, sadly) is that I have a bunch of food allergies, including gluten, dairy, eggs, and citrus.
