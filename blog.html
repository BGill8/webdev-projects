        <h3>Assingment 1 Entry</h3>
            <h5>October 13, 2024</h5>
            <p>I think that this first assignment went rather smoothly. The only trouble I had was initially setting up my VS Code to
                connect to the engineering servers so that I could edit my code on the servers rather than locally. I worked through this
                by looking up forums and getting help that way. This made it easier to push my changes to GitHub. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Some of things that I learned from this first assignment include: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Proper webpage structuring</li>
                    <li>Thinking about the user's usibility/visibility</li>
                    <li>Using HTML and implementing the 'link' and 'img' features</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Github and VS Code QandA pages were very helpful on this assignment, especially for the first set-up part.</p>
